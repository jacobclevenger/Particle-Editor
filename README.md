# Particle Editor

Particle code editor is a simple code editor built in NW.js. This is a small project that I started so I could learn NW.js, but I figured I would put it on here because it was kind of cool.

### Version 
0.0.1

### Particle Editor Uses The Following JavaScript Libraries

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [NW.js] - Web Apps in the desktop!
* [Polymer] - Web Components 
* [jQuery] - Sorry...

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Wheately/Particle-Editor.git
```
- Run nw.exe


### Todo

 - Only two menu buttons work, the rest need to work too.
 - Save/Create/Delete/Move folders in project tree.
 - Add predefined project templates.
 - Add dark theme.
